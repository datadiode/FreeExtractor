FreeExtractor v1.50, September 22, 2023

   - SFX: Fix a visual glitch at where the bottom frame leaves room for the watermark (groupbox comes to rescue).
   - SFX: Remove some cosmetic delays which I don't find useful.
   - SFX: When invoked with /autoextract, act as if created with that option in first place.
   - SFX: When the command line includes a /cut, exclude the remaining part of it from the $cmdline$ variable.
   - FEWIZARD: Make the auto-extract checkbox 3-state, to allow instructing the SFX to neglect /autoextract.

   - Cosmetic: Don't cause distracting flicker by displacing the splash page just to move it back instantly.

FreeExtractor v1.49, September 20, 2023

   - In addition to .ZIP, accept archives in .CAB format (but neglect the delete-files-after-extraction option).
   - Introduce the $cmdline$ placeholder to make arguments passed to the SFX available to the execution command.
   - Properly handle placeholders in other places than at the beginning, and prevent buffer overruns.
   - No longer treat $ and % as equivalent, to reduce risk of surprises due to conflicting environment variables.
   - Minor simplifications and cosmetic fixes.

   - FEWIZARD: Allow to pass a presets file on the command line, alongside with the Zip file.
   - SFX: Restore delete-files-after-extraction functionality which, if working, would have got lost in v1.46.
   - Restore the ability to change SFX icon which got lost in v1.45 due to moving SFX stubs to resources.

   - Again, yet more unnecessary refactorings.

FreeExtractor v1.46, September 9, 2023

   - FEWIZARD: Remove unchecked options from default.ini to prevent them from surprisingly coming back.
   - FEWIZARD: Don't let shortcuts from previously created SFXs silently creep into subsequent ones.
   - SFX: Parse PE headers to find out where the payload starts without scanning memory for a signature.
   - UI: Prefer Segoe UI font over Tahoma.
   - UI: Fix cursor flicker when hovering links.
   - Move SFX stubs and icon to resources to save the need for running them through bin2h.exe.
   - Adjust some buffer sizes to reduce risk of overflow.
   - Fix some memory and handle leaks.
   - Fix some wrong variable types.
   - Remove some redundant utility functions.
   - Yet more unnecessary refactorings.
